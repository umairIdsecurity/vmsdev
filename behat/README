This is the same for automation testing by using php Behat.
This will run in headless mode so that can't test with Javascript.

To run (this guideline is for Linux (Debian) only):
    - Install required library.In ~/vms/behat/ run:
        composer install

    - Move to ~/vms/behat/vms_project:
        cd vms_project

    - Update base_url to your vms application. Edit file behat.yml
        Currently, the sample set to:
            base_url: http://localhost/vms

    - Running sample test scripts:
        ../bin/behat


** For more information about test result report:
    - We can out test result in junit template (xml) by running:
        ../bin/behat --format junit --out <somewhere>
    - Jenkin-CI will read the result file as XML and generate statistic report.
    See https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/xUnit+Plugin for more detail.
